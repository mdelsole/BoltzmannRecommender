# BoltzmannRecommender
A recommender system built using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Using sample data on movies, it is trained to determine whether the user will like a new movie put into the system. It can give a binary response 0 (they wil not like the movie) or 1 (they will like the movie). 

As of now, it has about 75% accuracy, trained on 1682 movies and tested on 462 movies. Future updates involving tweaking various values (such as the number of hidden nodes) could potentially boost this number, but it will remain at 75% for now.
